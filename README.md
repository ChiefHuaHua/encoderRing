# encoderRing
Basic encoding program that has a sister program called, Decoder Ring.

8/8/18 - Just starting a new project on Git to stay in touch with my 
friends from a recent Python class at CSULA.

Hello friends! 

Need to keep practicing coding so I thought of a few projects to keep me going.

The first two will be sister programs. Encoder Ring and Decoder Ring.
Encoder Ring will at first take any user input and assign it to a single character.
To begin with I plan on just using the first 26 lowercase characters of the 
English alphabet and then move on from there to eventually include custom key
combinations.

The sister program Decoder Ring will take a given library created by Encoder Ring 
and use it to decode a message. Perhaps it seems simpler to combine the two programs 
into one but I think for safety it might be best to silo them off.
